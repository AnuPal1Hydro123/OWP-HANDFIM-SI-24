Flood Inundation Mapping in Cloud (FIM in CLOUD)

NOAA OWP operated HAND FIM model for operational flood forecasting across CONUS. It is a terrain based model that uses the Discharge and reach avergaed synthetic rating curves (SRCs) to generate the inundation and depth rasters at HUC-8 scale (Hydrologic Unit Code-8). The model is capable to produce flood maps less than a minute for all order streams available within the watershed. The HUC-8 watersheds have catchment area more than 1000 sqkm , from that regard this framework is quite scalable and computationaly efficient. It is a fluvial flood model and doesnot have urban flood compponant.The last released version of the model is 4.5and has gone through significant improvement.The significant modifcation that being done in the present notebook is enable the frameowrk to run from cloud, running mutiple HUC-8s simulteniously and adding both NWM retrospective and forecasting streamflow for United States.
